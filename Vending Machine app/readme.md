# Vending Machine Unity App

Welcome to the Vending Machine Unity App! This application provides a simple user interface for monitoring the weight of shelves in a vending machine. The app receives weight data via UDP protocol over an Ethernet cable. The weight data is generated from load cells connected to Codrino boards, which relay the data through Ethernet cables.

## Features

- Simple UI displaying the weight of shelves in a vending machine.
- Two shelves, each with three sections.
- Real-time weight updates received via UDP protocol.
- Built using Unity for cross-platform compatibility.

## Setup

To use the Vending Machine Unity App, follow these steps:

1. **Connect Load Cells to Codrino Boards:** Ensure that the load cells are properly connected to Codrino boards.
2. **Connect Codrino Boards to Ethernet Cables:** Connect the Codrino boards to the Ethernet cables for data transmission.
3. **Run the Unity App:** Launch the Vending Machine Unity App on your device.
4. **Monitor Shelf Weights:** View the weight of each shelf section displayed on the UI.

## Technologies Used

- **UDP Protocol:** Used for data transmission over Ethernet cables.
- **Codrino Boards:** Hardware for connecting load cells and transmitting data.
- **Unity:** Cross-platform game engine used for building the application.
