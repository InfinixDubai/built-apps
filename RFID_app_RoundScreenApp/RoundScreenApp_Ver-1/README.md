### Vending Machine Unity App

The Vending Machine Unity App provides a simple user interface for monitoring the weight of shelves in a vending machine. It receives weight data via UDP protocol over an Ethernet cable, generated from load cells connected to Codrino boards. Key features include:

- Simple UI displaying the weight of shelves.
- Real-time weight updates received via UDP protocol.
- Two shelves, each with three sections.
- Built using Unity for cross-platform compatibility.
